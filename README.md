## Introduction

In the age of digital security, passwords play a vital role in safeguarding your online presence. With cyber threats on the rise, it's crucial to have strong, random, and unique passwords for your various accounts. NeuralPassShield provides you with a solution that leverages LSTM neural networks to generate such passwords effortlessly.

Our password generator creates secure passwords by learning from a dataset of common passwords. The LSTM neural network is trained to predict the next character in a password, resulting in the generation of strong and unpredictable passwords.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NeuralPassShield.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn keras
   ```

## Usage

### Generating Passwords

To generate secure passwords, follow these steps:

1. Run the script and enter the desired password length and the number of passwords you want to generate.

   ```shell
   python password_generator.py
   ```

2. The script will utilize the trained LSTM model to produce strong, random passwords, which will be displayed in the terminal.

### Customization

You can customize the password generation process to suit your needs. Modify the characters and special characters used for password generation in the code. Additionally, you can adjust the training parameters, such as epochs and batch size, to fine-tune the model's performance.

## Advanced Features

### Early Stopping

The model incorporates early stopping, ensuring efficient training and preventing overfitting. The training process will stop if validation loss does not improve for a specified number of epochs.

### Performance Measurement

The repository also provides functionality to measure the speed of password generation for different password lengths, helping you understand the model's efficiency.
